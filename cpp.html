    <p class="title">Basic Shoot 'em up template</p>
    <p class="ps">
      This video is a shoot 'em up template that i made in C++ using directx 11
      rendering 3d images with textures into the start and game over menus,I
      also use a 2d ship with a paralax scrolling background in the main game.

    <p class="title">Software hardware optimisation</p>
    <p class="grapple">
      This video shows two examples of software hardware optimisation skills in
      two different games, the first of which "Dino Tiles" was mainly optimised
      by switching to a data oriented design and monitoring the code quality, a
      good example of this is changing data types from doubles to floats when
      floats are not necessary. In the 2nd game which just shows particles
      moving across a screen was mainly optimised using threads, although other
      methods I used include passing by refference and once again monitoring the
      code quality. I also used imGUI to monitor certain statistics
