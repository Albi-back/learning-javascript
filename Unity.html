    <p class="title">My Showreel</p>

    <p class="ps">
      This is the showreel level that I made in college and was one of my
      earliest unity projects. It starts as a 2d platformer in the 1st level
      with a stereotypical boss and enemies with powerups the red powerup is a
      speed boost and the blue power up is a projectile. In the second level
      there is a switch in perspective to a 3d world with a sword, primitive
      climbing and grappling mechanics.
